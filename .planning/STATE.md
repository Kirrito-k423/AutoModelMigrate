# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-16)

**Core value:** Make cross-framework and cross-accelerator model migration repeatable, measurable, and safe.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — veomni-minimax-m3-intake

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (veomni-minimax-m3-intake) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4
Status: Ready for Wave 3 reusable templates
Last activity: 2026-06-16 -- Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [████████░░] 75%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3 | 4 | 5 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1 starts from VeOmni + MiniMax M3 to ground the framework in a hard real case.
- GPU and NPU support will be modeled through backend capabilities.
- Repository publication target is `https://github.com/Kirrito-k423/AutoModelMigrate.git`; local `origin` is configured.
- Ascend NPU runtime readiness is tracked through `$HOME/.codex/skills/ascend-npu-runtime`.
- `gh` 2.94.0 is installed under `$HOME/.local`; GitHub authentication is still pending.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- MiniMax M3 details are very recent; implementation planning must keep source links and assumptions explicit.
- This project is already initialized; rerunning `$gsd-new-project` should be treated as alignment/update work, while `$gsd-progress` shows the official current state.
- Current Ascend host is not NPU-ready yet: normal-user `npu-smi info` fails with DCMI `ret=-8005`, the user reports root can see `npu-smi info`, CANN toolkit is missing, and `torch`/`torch_npu` are not installed.
- CANN must be downloaded from the official HiAscend community page after version-matrix confirmation; avoid speculative downloads because the packages are large.
